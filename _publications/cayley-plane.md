title: "A Laurent phenomenon for the Cayley plane"
collection: publications
permalink: /publication/cayley-plane
excerpt: 'We describe a Laurent phenomenon for the Cayley plane, which is the homogeneous variety associated to the cominuscule representation of $$E_6$$. The corresponding Laurent phenomenon algebra has finite type and appears in a natural sequence of LPAs indexed by the $$E_n$$ Dynkin diagrams for $$n\leq 6$$. We conjecture the existence of a further finite type LPA, associated to the Freudenthal variety of type $$E_7$$.'
