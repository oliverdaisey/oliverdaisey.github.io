# Welcome to my personal website.

I am a third year Ph.D. student in mathematics working in computational geometry, with interests in cluster algebras and tropical geometry. My work has a general theme of approaching mathematical problems with software. My academic supervisors are [Anna Felikson](https://www.maths.dur.ac.uk/users/anna.felikson/) and [Yue Ren](https://www.yueren.de/). Previously I was supervised by [Tom Ducat](https://sites.google.com/site/tomducatmaths/).

I am a developer for the [OSCAR](https://docs.oscar-system.org/dev/) and [SageMath](https://www.sagemath.org/) mathematics software systems. My primary development machines run Ubuntu and MacOS.
