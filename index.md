# Welcome to my personal website.

I am a mathematician (third year Ph.D. student) working in areas of cluster algebras and tropical geometry, especially in computationally rich problems. My academic supervisors are [Anna Felikson](https://www.maths.dur.ac.uk/users/anna.felikson/) and [Tom Ducat](https://sites.google.com/site/tomducatmaths/).
